This project is a simple yet interactive web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes:

Rock, Paper, Scissors Game: A fun game that lets users play Rock, Paper, Scissors with the computer. The game logic is implemented in JavaScript, and the interface is styled with CSS.

Amazon Cart with Price Calculation: A custom Amazon product card where the user can input the price of the item. The app automatically calculates the delivery charges and displays the total amount (price + delivery) for a seamless shopping experience.


YouTube Subscribe Button: A dynamic button that toggles between "Subscribe" and "Subscribed" when clicked, simulating YouTube's subscription behavior.


This project demonstrates essential web development skills and serves as a useful learning tool for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts like DOM manipulation and event handling.
